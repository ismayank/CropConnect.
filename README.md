Crop-Connect is a mobile application that facilitates direct transactions between farmers and customers for the purchase of fresh, locally sourced fruits and vegetables. By eliminating middlemen, the app aims to provide farmers with better prices for their produce while offering customers convenient access to high-quality goods at competitive rates. The traditional agricultural supply chain often results in farmers receiving a disproportionately low share of the final consumer price due to multiple intermediaries. Crop-Connect addresses this issue by empowering farmers to take control of their earnings and enabling customers to support local agriculture.
The app aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, promoting responsible consumption, reducing food waste, and supporting sustainable farming practices. It contributes to poverty alleviation and food security by enhancing economic opportunities for small-scale farmers in rural areas. This app offers a user-friendly platform where farmers can create profiles, list produce, and manage orders, while customers can browse, place orders, make secure payments, and track deliveries. A transparent rating and review system fosters trust and accountability between buyers and sellers.
By disrupting the traditional supply chain, Crop-Connect aims to promote sustainable practices, empower small-scale farmers, and ensure a reliable source of fresh, locally-grown produce for conscious consumers
